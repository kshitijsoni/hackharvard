## 💡 Inspiration

**"Understanding is deeper than knowledge"**

Understanding is the most difficult for a person. Nowadays, Every student needs self-learning. But self-learning is more effective when there is better understanding. Understanding will become easier while visualizing the concepts rather than reading. For this, we have developed a web app where students can learn various concepts with the help of 3D and AR. So Students can understand the concepts more easily. If the concepts are understood, then learning will become easier. Moreover, students will be more attracted to learning while learning through 3D concepts.

**Advantage:**

The foremost benefit of this app is that we are using 3D and AR that helps the students to learn tough concepts more easily. A key benefit of AR technology is that it allows students to get involved in the process of developing lesson plans in collaboration with teachers. 3D animation gives comic relief in most instances which makes it interesting to viewers. So with the help of these two, we developed this app and through this app, every learner will learn tough concepts easily and with more interest.

## 💻 What it does

Users can sign in to our web app and then the student can search their content. They will redirect to their content page. They can ask their doubts and that doubts will be clarified soon using Twilio.

## 🔨 How we built it

We have used React js for our web development and using three js for rendering 3D models and making them interactive. We have used echo 3D and also Twilio API.

## Most Creative Use of Twilio

- Twilio provides a ton of other awesome communication features using web service APIs. We have used to Twilio for make the chatroom.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge was to rendering the 3D model and adding AR functionality to them, which I overcome using three js and echoAR.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Gives an easier way for students to learn the toughest concepts.
- Best coordination among team members and works very hard to complete this project.

## 📖 What we learned

- We have learned a lot about Twilio and we were glad to be able to use their services in our project.
- Importance of teamwork.

## 🚀 What's next for HackHaward

- We are planning to make some improvements depending on the user’s feedback.
- And also planning to make it available for persons in all sectors.
